CONVERT XML TO HMTL : THE SAMPLE XML FILE USED IS airlinelist.xml

The html file displays all the information in airlinelist.xml as a table in html file using javascript.


SEARCH.php :
A webpage that allows the user to search for information about a set of Facebook entities (i.e., users, pages, events, places, and groups) using the Facebook Graph API, and the results are displayed in a tabular format.


Responsive Web Design:
Created a webpage that allows users to query about users, pages, groups, events and places on Facebook. Created a PHP script to return a JSON formatted data stream to the front-end. Parsed the JSON data and rendered in a responsive UI (i.e., using Bootstrap). A user first opens the webpage. The page includes a navigation menu at the top and the usersâ€™ information table at the bottom. Once the user opens this page, all of the queried data is loaded using the AJAX component in Angular JS. The AJAX code calls the PHP script. The webpage uses JavaScript to extract data from the JSON response and display the results on the same webpage.
